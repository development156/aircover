## wt-db: `posts` and `post_variants` are not in the `supabase_realtime` publication

`packages/db/supabase/migrations/20260725102928_ops_platform_tables.sql:314-320` is the only
`alter publication supabase_realtime` in the repo, and it adds exactly four tables:
`ops_tasks, ops_changelog, ops_qa_runs, ops_sessions` — the admin dashboard's own live board.
Nothing has ever published `posts` or `post_variants`.

**Consequence:** the posts and planner surfaces cannot subscribe to publish state. A scheduled
post moves `draft → scheduled → publishing → published` entirely server-side (the sweep runs on
a five-minute cron, `apps/web/vercel.json`), and until this lane's change the UI learned about
none of it without a manual reload.

**Shipped instead:** a bounded poll of our own Postgres (`readPublishState`), off entirely when
nothing is in flight and when the tab is hidden. It costs Zernio nothing, so it is safe against
the 60/min ceiling shared with analytics and the inbox — but it is a fallback, not the design.

**Ask:** add both tables to the publication.

```sql
alter publication supabase_realtime add table posts, post_variants;
```

**Answered, not applied — read this before writing it again (added 2026-08-11).** The
migration exists: `packages/db/supabase/migrations/20260811000000_realtime_publish_state.sql`,
written on the `wt-db2` lane and merged to mainline in the same sequence that landed this
file. It does more than the one line above — it guards the publication AND each table
independently, because `alter publication ... add table` raises `duplicate_object` if
membership was ever set from the dashboard's Publications toggle, which leaves no trace in
this directory.

It is **written and NOT APPLIED.** Nothing has run it against any database, so the two
questions below are still open and still belong with the apply, not after it. The migration's
own header says this request is "NOT yet on wt-web, so a reader of the mainline file will not
find it" — that sentence was true when it was written and is now out of date, since both are
here. It is left uncorrected deliberately: this lane does not edit that directory.

Default replica identity is sufficient — this lane needs only the NEW row state (status,
scheduled_at, publish_status, permalink, platform_post_id), never the old values, so
`replica identity full` is not requested and would only widen the WAL.

**Two things worth deciding with it, not after it:**

1. **RLS on the subscription.** `postgres_changes` filters per subscriber against the row's
   policies, so the existing member policies should scope it correctly — but nothing here has
   been exercised against a second workspace. That test belongs with the migration, not with
   the client: an over-broad publication is a tenancy leak, not a UI bug.
2. **The client has no authenticated browser Supabase client yet.** `lib/supabase/server.ts` is
   `server-only` and `lib/ops/service-rpc.ts` is service-role. A browser client would need the
   Clerk token wired through `accessToken`, the same way the server one is. That is this lane's
   work once the publication exists, not wt-db's.

**Not blocking.** The polled path is shipped, tested and honest about its own limits. Everything
in `lib/posts/live-state.ts` is fed by a single `PublishSnapshot`, so replacing the timer with a
subscription changes `publish-state-provider.tsx` and nothing else — no card, no payload, no test.

**Unverified, and cheaply checkable:** the publication contents were inferred from the migrations,
not read. The Supabase MCP is unauthorized in this session and `.env` is permission-blocked, so
nobody has run this against the live database:

```sql
select tablename from pg_publication_tables where pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
```

## wt-web: `<Button asChild>` throws on any child with more than one node — NOT fixed here

`src/components/ui/button.tsx` renders `{loading ? <Loader2/> : null}{children}` inside `Comp`.
With `asChild`, `Comp` is Radix `Slot`, which requires exactly one element child — so it receives
two nodes and throws _"Slot failed to slot onto its children"_ at render, not at typecheck. Note
this happens whether or not `loading` is set: `null` is still a second child node.

The inbox lane was the first caller to try it
(`<Button asChild><Link><Icon/>Open connections</Link></Button>`), so the path has never run in
this codebase. A production build would have shipped it.

Two defects in one, both on the `asChild` path only — the plain `<button>` path is fine:

1. **Slot arity.** Fix by wrapping: `<Comp>{asChild ? <Slottable>{children}</Slottable> : <>…</>}</Comp>`,
   or by refusing `loading` when `asChild` is set. The second is arguably more honest — a link has
   no pending state to show.
2. **`disabled` on an anchor.** `disabled={disabled || loading}` is forwarded to whatever element
   the child renders. On an `<a>` that attribute is not valid and does not disable anything, so a
   "disabled" link stays clickable.

**Worked around, not fixed:** `buttonVariants` is now exported (one-line, standard shadcn shape) and
`components/inbox/surface-notice.tsx` applies it to a plain `<Link>`. A shared control's `asChild`
path deserves its own review and test rather than a drive-by from a feature lane.

## wt-pub: `ZernioPlatformFilter` cannot express the conversations surface

`packages/publishing/src/zernio/reads.ts:190` types the `platform` filter on `listConversations`
as `facebook | instagram | twitter | bluesky | reddit | telegram`. It has **no `whatsapp` member**,
and no `googlebusiness` either.

WhatsApp is one of the three platforms with a modelled reply window
(`@sahoda/shared` `SEND_WINDOWS`), so a per-platform tab built on this filter would silently drop
WhatsApp conversations from a list the user reads as complete.

**Meanwhile:** the inbox reads every conversation unfiltered and labels each row's platform. No tab
filter ships. The lane did **not** cast past the type — a cast here would produce exactly the silent
omission the filter's narrowness is warning about.

**Ask:** confirm whether the omission reflects Zernio's actual accepted values (in which case the
conversations list can never be filtered to WhatsApp server-side and paging must account for it), or
whether the union is simply incomplete.

## ~~wt-pub: `ZernioMessage.direction` is `[DOC]`-tier and load-bearing~~ — CORRECTED `[LIVE 2026-08-10]`

The documented value was **wrong**, not merely unconfirmed. Zernio sends **`"incoming"` /
`"outgoing"`**; `'inbound'` appears in no real payload.

Both predicted consequences had already shipped, and a second one had not been predicted:

1. `newestInboundAt` returned null for every thread, so **every reply affordance rendered
   `unknown` permanently** — the honest degradation that looks exactly like a working feature.
2. **Not foreseen:** `components/inbox/message-list.tsx` compared the same literal to choose
   which side a bubble renders on. Every message in every thread — including the customer's —
   rendered on the right, in the owner's colour, labelled **"You"**. Sahoda put the customer's
   words in the shop owner's mouth, in the thread they were reading to decide how to reply.

**Fixed** by `messageDirection()` in `packages/publishing/src/zernio/reads.ts` — one place, both
callers, and an unrecognised value now logs and resolves to `unknown` rather than defaulting to
ours. `direction` stays typed `string`: Instagram is the only platform whose thread has been read,
and Facebook/WhatsApp may yet speak differently.

**No ask outstanding.** Captures under `packages/publishing/fixtures/zernio-inbox/`.

## ~~wt-pub: is `ZernioConversation.accountId` the same id as `ZernioAccount._id`?~~ — RESOLVED `[LIVE 2026-08-10]`

**Yes.** Against profile `6a75cae32853ee463c6419d6`, all four report
`6a75caf7d0fe733d1afcc1f4`: `ZernioAccount._id`, `ZernioConversation.accountId`,
`ZernioCommentedPost.accountId` and `ZernioMessage.accountId`. `external_account->>'id'` was
already verified to hold the same value, so the join is correct and no thread or comments row
404s on an id-space mismatch.

The sibling row type (`ZernioCommentedPost`, which feeds the identical join through
`/inbox/comments/[accountId]/[platformPostId]`) was checked in the same pass and is pinned
alongside it in `packages/publishing/src/zernio/inbox-live.test.ts`.

**No ask outstanding.** `lib/zernio/scope.ts` re-tiered.

## wt-pub: `meta.accountsQueried` counts something we cannot name

`[LIVE 2026-08-10]` `/inbox/conversations?profileId=6a75cae32853ee463c6419d6` returned
`meta.accountsQueried: 2`. That profile has **one** account, and `GET /accounts` **unscoped**
returns exactly **one** account on the entire API key — so 2 is not a count of accounts in any
sense we share, scoped or not. The unscoped conversations call reports the same 2.

**Impact, already fixed here:** `emptiness.ts` rendered it verbatim as _"All 2 connected accounts
answered"_ to a customer with one Instagram account. The `ok` and `empty` branches no longer print
a count; the `partial` branch keeps Zernio's own `N of M` ratio intact, since cross-sourcing it
against our `connections` count would produce the worse lie _"2 of 1 did not answer"_.

The `accountsQueried === 0` comparison is untouched and is confirmed correct — the live reviews
payload reports 0 with no GBP ever connected, and resolves to "connect an account".

**Ask:** what does `accountsQueried` count — accounts, per-account sub-queries (DM + story replies?),
or something else? It is the only signal distinguishing "asked nobody" from "asked and got nothing",
so its unit matters even though we no longer print it.

---

## wt-pub: `/inbox/comments` returns every post, not posts with comments

`[LIVE 2026-08-10]` it returned **six** posts for `@testingg53`, of which **one** carried comments
(`commentCount: 2`); the other five were `0`. The endpoint name, `reads.ts` and
`commented-post-row.tsx` all described it as "the posts that have comments".

**Impact, already fixed here:** `rows > 0` was permanently true, so the surface rendered _"Showing
your comments"_ for a workspace with no comments anywhere and the _"No comments yet"_ state was
unreachable. `lib/inbox/commented-posts.ts` now filters before classification, and `hasMore` is
threaded through so a page that filters down to empty with more behind it says "could not confirm"
rather than "none yet".

**Ask:** is there a server-side filter (a `hasComments` or `minComments` parameter) so paging does
not have to over-fetch? Filtering client-side means a page of 50 posts can yield 0 rows while the
comments sit on page 2.

---

## wt-pub: `/inbox/comments/{postId}` omits `nextCursor` entirely

`[LIVE 2026-08-10]` its `pagination` is `{"hasMore": false}` — the object is present and the field
is absent, so `data.pagination ?? EMPTY_CURSOR` never fired and `undefined` flowed out through a
field typed `string | null`. Fixed with a per-field `cursor()` normaliser in `reads.ts`; no UI
consumed it yet, so this was type-honesty ahead of paging rather than a live symptom.

Same call's `meta` is a different shape again — `{platform, postId, accountId, lastUpdated}`, with
no `accountsQueried` — and `/inbox/conversations/{id}/messages` sends no `meta` at all. `reads.ts`
had claimed `ZernioInboxMeta` rode on every `/inbox/*` response; corrected.

**Ask:** confirm whether the omitted `nextCursor` means "no more" or "cursors unsupported on this
endpoint". They page differently and only one of them is safe to build a "load more" on.

## ~~wt-db: `NOT_RESCHEDULABLE` is restated in apps/web~~ — CLOSED 2026-08-10

**Resolved by the second of the two options asked for: a divergence test.**

The hand copy is gone. `NOT_RESCHEDULABLE_STATUSES` now lives in
`@sahoda/shared` (`publishing/schedule.ts`, beside `DISPATCHABLE_STATUSES`), `savePost`
imports it, and `packages/db/tests/schedule_guard_parity.test.ts` parses the guard back out
of the migrations and fails if either SQL list stops matching. It needs no database, so it
runs in the credential-free sandbox and on every `turbo test` — verified red in both
directions before being declared done.

**The request understated the problem: there were THREE copies, not two.**
`release_post_for_publish` (`20260804000000_publish_claim.sql:231`) carries the same four
statuses under a different error name — POST_NOT_RELEASABLE rather than
POST_NOT_RESCHEDULABLE — and was never mentioned. The test binds both. A fourth copy was
hardcoded in `posts-save.test.ts`'s `test.each`, which is the worst place for one: it would
have kept passing against its own list while the product used a different one.

**Still open, and still wt-db's to give if it wants it:** a `posts_reschedulable(status)`
SQL helper would let both functions and apps/web read one definition instead of three
agreeing ones. The test makes drift _loud_; only the helper makes it impossible.

Context: 2026-08-10. Two posts carried a fresh `scheduled_at` while still `expired`; the
only symptom was a cron sweep that never found them.
